    "# Configuration Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Configuration management ensures that IT systems, devices, and applications maintain a secure and consistent state across the enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Prevents misconfigurations that attackers often exploit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Provides a repeatable, controlled process for updates and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Reduces vulnerabilities caused by ad-hoc modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Ensures compliance with regulatory frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "* Importance: Visual representations of network and system design are crucial for security analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Show how systems connect, where security controls are applied, and potential attack paths.\n",
    "    * Help identify single points of failure, shadow IT, or unprotected entry points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best Practices: Keep diagrams updated with assets, firewalls, VPNs, data flows, and trust boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Baseline Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Definition: A known, secure starting point for systems, networks, and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Acts as a reference for detecting unauthorized changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Ensures every system starts hardened (e.g., patched OS, least privilege accounts, secure protocols).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: A baseline Windows server may have specific services disabled, patches applied, and firewall rules enforced before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Standard Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Role in Security: Consistent naming makes system identification, monitoring, and auditing easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Prevents confusion that attackers could exploit (e.g., disguising malicious hosts).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Simplifies log correlation and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Servers may be named by role and location (e.g., NYC-WEB-01 for a web server in New York City).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Internet Protocol (IP) Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "* Definition: The structured plan for assigning IP addresses within an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Security Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Prevents IP conflicts and rogue devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Enables segmentation of sensitive systems (e.g., HR, Finance) using subnets and VLANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Supports zero trust by restricting lateral movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best Practices: Document IP ranges, assign static IPs for critical assets, and monitor DHCP for anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "In enterprise security architecture, configuration management (with diagrams, baselines, naming conventions, and IP schema) ensures that systems are standardized, traceable, and less vulnerable to exploitation. These practices support both security operations and incident response by providing visibility, consistency, and control.\n",
