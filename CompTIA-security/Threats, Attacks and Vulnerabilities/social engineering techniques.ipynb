    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shoulder surfing is the act of spying on someone’s screen, keyboard, or device to obtain sensitive information such as PINs, passwords, or account numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attackers observe directly (standing nearby) or use tools (binoculars, cameras, CCTV) to secretly gather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "* Direct Observation: Attacker literally looks “over the shoulder” of the victim at an ATM, laptop, or phone.\n",
    "* Long-Range Surveillance: Attackers may use binoculars, high-res cameras, or CCTV feeds.\n",
    "* Crowded Places: Airports, cafés, public transport, or open offices make it easy.\n",
    "* Data Capture: Information like PIN codes, credentials, or sensitive emails is noted down.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Watching someone enter their ATM PIN at a cash machine.\n",
    "* Glancing at a coworker’s laptop to see confidential emails.\n",
    "* Recording a user’s smartphone screen while they log into banking apps.\n",
    "* Using a hidden camera in an office to capture logins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "* People are often careless about their screen visibility in public places.\n",
    "* Attackers exploit crowded or high-traffic environments where victims are distracted.\n",
    "* No technical skill needed — just visual access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Dumpster Diving\n",
    "| **Technique**        | **Medium**            | **Focus**                            |\n",
    "| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| **Dumpster Diving**  | Trash/Discarded items | Collect printed or physical data     |\n",
    "| **Shoulder Surfing** | Direct observation    | Capture info from screens or keypads |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks of Shoulder Surfing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identity Theft: Using stolen PINs, SSNs, or credit card numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Account Compromise: Gaining login credentials to email, corporate portals, or bank accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corporate Espionage: Observing employees working on confidential projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Financial Fraud: Using stolen ATM PINs or online banking credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defenses Against Shoulder Surfing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Privacy Filters (Screen Protectors): Limit viewing angles so only the user sees the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Awareness: Be cautious in public areas — shield screens/keypads when entering info.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positioning: Sit with your back to a wall in public spaces; avoid facing crowds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Even if login details are observed, MFA adds protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monitoring CCTV: In workplaces, review for suspicious observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Employees: Remind staff not to expose sensitive data in open/public areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "Shoulder surfing is a low-tech, high-impact attack where attackers steal sensitive data simply by watching someone’s actions. It emphasizes that cybersecurity is not only about digital tools but also about physical awareness.\n"
