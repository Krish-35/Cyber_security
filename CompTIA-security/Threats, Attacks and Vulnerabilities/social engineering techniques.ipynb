    "\n",
    "* Shoulder surfing is the act of spying on someone’s screen, keyboard, or device to obtain sensitive information such as PINs, passwords, or account numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attackers observe directly (standing nearby) or use tools (binoculars, cameras, CCTV) to secretly gather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "* Direct Observation: Attacker literally looks “over the shoulder” of the victim at an ATM, laptop, or phone.\n",
    "* Long-Range Surveillance: Attackers may use binoculars, high-res cameras, or CCTV feeds.\n",
    "* Crowded Places: Airports, cafés, public transport, or open offices make it easy.\n",
    "* Data Capture: Information like PIN codes, credentials, or sensitive emails is noted down.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Concrete defenses & mitigations (practical)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For individuals\n",
    "* Use strong, unique passwords + a password manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enable MFA (prefer authenticator apps or hardware keys over SMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be skeptical of unsolicited messages — verify by contacting organizations through official channels (not links or numbers in the message).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monitor credit reports and set fraud alerts or credit freezes where available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shred sensitive documents before discarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lock devices and use full-disk encryption on laptops/phones.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Use anti-phishing and mobile security apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For organizations\n",
    "* Least privilege & role-based access control (RBAC-Role Based Access Control): limit access to PII(Personal Identity Information).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-factor authentication for access to sensitive systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anomalous login detection: monitor for impossible travel, abnormal times, new devices, and block suspicious sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Employee training: phishing simulations, data handling procedures, and reporting workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data minimization & encryption: store minimal PII, encrypt at rest and in transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Secure disposal: locked bins, cross-cut shredders, certified media destruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identity proofing & out-of-band verification: require secondary confirmation for high-risk actions (wire transfers, payroll changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incident response & remediation playbooks for ATO(AccountTakeOver) and identity fraud events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection & recovery steps after identity fraud (practical checklist)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Freeze credit and place fraud alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Report to financial institutions & dispute fraudulent charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* File a police report and keep a copy for creditors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change passwords and enable MFA.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoice scams are fraudulent billing schemes where attackers send fake invoices or payment requests that appear legitimate. The goal is to trick the victim — either an individual or a business — into paying money or revealing financial details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Invoice Scams Work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Impersonation of a vendor or supplier\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attacker spoofs or mimics a trusted vendor’s identity.\n",
    "* Sends a fake invoice for goods/services never delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Email spoofing / Business Email Compromise (BEC)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Victim receives an invoice from what looks like an internal executive or financial officer.\n",
    "* Urgency is applied to pressure quick payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.Compromised accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real vendor accounts are hacked, and fake invoices are sent from genuine email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Payment redirection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Invoices include fraudulent bank account details (attacker’s account).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* A small business receives an invoice “from their IT supplier” for renewal of licenses. The attacker uses a look-alike domain (supplier-tech.com vs. suppliertech.com).\n",
    "* An employee in accounts payable gets a spoofed email from the CEO, demanding immediate payment of an attached invoice.\n",
    "* Fake invoices sent for office supplies, cleaning services, or software licenses that never existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Invoice Scams Work\n",
    "\n",
    "* Relies on trust in business processes (AP teams are used to processing invoices).\n",
    "* Exploits authority and urgency principles of social engineering.\n",
    "* Often uses look-alike domains or spoofed sender addresses.\n",
    "* AP staff are under pressure to process many invoices quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks and Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Direct financial loss: Payments made to attackers’ accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data exposure: Attackers may also gather bank details or supplier account info.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reputation damage: Clients or vendors may lose trust in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regulatory/legal issues: If attackers steal customer PII in the process.\n",

    "### Defenses Against Invoice Scams\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Employee Training\n",
    "* AP/finance staff should be trained to spot spoofed invoices or urgent payment requests.\n",
    "#### 2. Verification Procedures\n",
    "* Require out-of-band verification (phone call to known number) before large or unusual payments.\n",
    "#### 3. Email Security\n",
    "* Use SPF, DKIM, DMARC to reduce spoofed emails.\n",
    "* Deploy anti-phishing filters.\n",
    "#### 4. Segregation of Duties\n",
    "* Require dual approval for large payments.\n",
    "#### 5. Vendor Management\n",
    "* Maintain an approved vendor database with validated contact/payment info.\n",
    "* Regularly audit vendor accounts.\n",
    "#### 6. Bank Security Features\n",
    "* Use positive pay, ACH filters, and alerts for new payment instructions.\n",

    "* Access user accounts (banking, email, corporate portals).\n",
    "* Sell them on the dark web.\n",
    "* Use them in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Credential Harvesting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Phishing / Social Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fake login pages trick users into entering credentials.\n",
    "* Example: A spoofed Office 365 login portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Keyloggers / Malware\n",
    "\n",
    "* Installed on victim devices to capture keystrokes or browser-saved passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attackers intercept credentials during transmission (e.g., on public Wi-Fi without HTTPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Database Breaches\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stolen credentials from compromised websites are dumped and sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Browser Credential Theft\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attackers extract saved credentials from browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Pysical / Insider Theft\n",
    "\n",
    "* Employees or attackers steal password lists, sticky notes, or unsecured documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Victim clicks a phishing email → enters Office 365 credentials on a fake site → attacker uses them for email takeover.\n",
    "* Malware steals saved Chrome passwords → sends them to attacker’s server.\n",
